# Development of a model for detecting mammals using photos from UAV

## Description
UAVs by VMAS'Ñ‹ is a project providing a ML-model capable to identify mammals on images and video by using a UAVs. 

## We use:
- PyTorch framework  - for machine learning and deep learning
- Yolo v8 - due to the its flexibility, high speed and accuracy of object detection
- Cloud.ru - as an assistant for the development, deployment and scaling of machine learning application
- Docker - for due to reliability, ease of deployment and scalability
- Flask or FastApi - for web application development
- PostgreSQL - as a storage for data
- *WebSockets - for low latency, continuous and two-way connection (ML - Web or Web-DB)

## You can copy git by:
git clone https://github.com/AdneryMaslov/UAVs.git
